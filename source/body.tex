\section*{Question \#1}


\question{Consider the angle $\theta$ in with measure $-495^\circ$.}

The problem with this question is that I was trying to be smart by simplifying $-495^\circ$ to $225^\circ$, so thereafter all of my subsequent work was using an angle co-terminal to $-495^\circ$. In this context, my mistake was equating co-terminal angles as being the same, but this only applies to the output of periodic functions where co-terminal angles \textbf{map to the same value}, but the arguments themselves represent different measures.

\subsection*{Question \#1 (A)}

Using the following relation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
x^{\circ} = \frac{x}{360} \tau \; {\displaystyle {\text{rad}}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

I can express $-495^\circ$ in terms of turns (or $\tau$) like so:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
-495^{\circ} &= \frac{-495}{360} \tau \; {\displaystyle {\text{rad}}} \\
    &= -\frac{11}{8} \tau \; {\displaystyle {\text{rad}}} \\
    &= - 1\frac{3}{8} \; \tau
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Since this angle is expressed in terms of turns, we have a intuitive idea about how the graph the given angle. I.e. because $-\frac{3}{8}$ can be considered a ratio of a circle, which is easy to picture, in the same manner that $\frac{3}{4}$ of a circle is easy to imagine, compared to e.g. $\frac{3}{2}$ half circles.

\newpage

Therefore, I know that this angle makes one full revolution, and $-\frac{3}{8}$ of a revolution (going clockwise), which results in the following figure correctly drawn in the context of a $-495^\circ$ angle:

\end{tikzpicture}
\end{figure}

\subsection*{Question \#1 (B)}

Using the following relation:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
x^{\circ} = \frac{x}{360} (2\pi) \; {\displaystyle {\text{rad}}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

I can \textbf{correctly} express $-495^\circ$ degrees in terms of radians like so:
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
-495^{\circ} &= \frac{-495}{360} (2\pi) \; {\displaystyle {\text{rad}}} \\
    &= -\frac{11}{8} (2\pi) \; {\displaystyle {\text{rad}}} \\
    &= -\frac{11}{4} \pi \; {\displaystyle {\text{rad}}}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\answer{$-\frac{11}{4} \pi \; {\displaystyle {\text{rad}}}$}


\subsection*{Question \#1 (C)}

\section*{Question \#3}

This should have been correct, what happens is my brain frequently gets things mixed up, i.e. there was a disconnect between my internal thoughts and what manifested on paper. I know that $\sec(x)$ is the reciprocal of $\cos(x)$, just as $\csc(x)$ is the reciprocal of $\sin(x)$, and that $\cot(x)$ is the reciprocal of $\tan(x)$, and furthermore in the context of the unit circle, that $\sin(\theta)$ represents the y value, and that $\cos(\theta)$ represents the x value. 

Therefore, given the some $P(-20, 21)$ for $\theta$:

\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
r &= \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} = 29 \\
\sin(\theta) &= \frac{y}{r} = \frac{21}{29} \\
\sec(\theta) &= \frac{r}{x} = \frac{29}{-20} = -\frac{29}{20}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\answer{$\sin(\theta) = \frac{21}{29}$, $\sec(\theta) = -\frac{29}{20}$}
    

\section*{Question \#4}

This was one of those questions where I wonder if I’m just dumb, or if it’s legitimately a hard problem… Either way something I would have failed at regardless.
